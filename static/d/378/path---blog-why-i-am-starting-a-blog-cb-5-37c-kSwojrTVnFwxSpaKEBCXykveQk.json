It’s my last year at university. I was born in Eskişehir, moved around in Turkey because of my parents’ work and after I got into university, I started to live in Istanbul. After starting to my university, I always tried to improve myself in the software field. I joined the ITUNOM team in my first year of university. As a team, we participated in the AUVSI SUAS competition, which is the best-known competition for students in the field of unmanned aerial systems in Maryland, USA. After 2 years of work in ITUNOM team, I started to work in a\nstartup which develops IOT systems for agriculture. I worked here part-time as a mobile application developer for approximately 1 year and I resigned after a year in order to focus more on the school. After a couple of months without responsibilities except school, I decided to start a blog.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4b48a121cee129ea878b1e021a0d251a/df95b/postcover.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 19.37869822485207%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAECAYAAACOXx+WAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAA6klEQVQY02N4z8RAMXiNLvCOiYHpPTuD8gduBtH3bAxsH8UZOD4IMAh/YGfg/yjMwP6GgYH1AxcDy0dBBmagGskPvAzqQHG+D/wMbG+BciAz7gPxZy2ogV9t2Vi/2jG7fHVkcfzmzurwzZXFBsi2/ebG6vjdm9XzexCb4zdvVuXvvqyG39xY9IBq/IHiVkBxnx9h7JYgM37EcDJ+tYUa+P+nGsP//wpM/w9KMf/tEWb9v1GC6f9/Xcb/myWY/00WYf/XJSjxr1+Q5W+nIPP//xqM/z+rM/2/qMr4b5IY/79+URGQGf+6wBQDAMLOThObw3b9AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Starting a Blog\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4b48a121cee129ea878b1e021a0d251a/40fad/postcover.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4b48a121cee129ea878b1e021a0d251a/707e9/postcover.png 148w,\n/static/4b48a121cee129ea878b1e021a0d251a/649e0/postcover.png 295w,\n/static/4b48a121cee129ea878b1e021a0d251a/40fad/postcover.png 590w,\n/static/4b48a121cee129ea878b1e021a0d251a/df95b/postcover.png 676w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Why I am starting a blog?</h2>\n<p>There are 3 main reasons to start this blog for me. </p>\n<h3>1- Reminders! I don’t want to forget any work I do, even small things.</h3>\n<hr>\n<p>The most important reason for starting a blog is this in my perspective because when I try to do\na work which is similar or same work which is I have done before, sometimes I can not remember and\nstart from nothing again and again. While I am updating my CV, in the skills section I am hesitating for writing some skills which I earned before because the passing time makes you forget them and these kinds of old skills can cause problems in interviews. So in order to don’t forget any skill or even I forget, try to remember them easily, I want to collect my all work in well-documented reports and do this in blog post format. </p>\n<h3>2- Motivation! I believe that this blog will make me motivate for being more productive.</h3>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the most other important reason is that being more productive. After starting this blog, I need to create content for the blog, this means that I need to work more to write new posts. I need to think more about what should I do for the blog and how should I do. I am thinking like that people will be accessible to my writings, everybody can read, my writings must be completely correct. Basically, I will push myself harder to create more helpful and educative contents. Sometimes when I get lazy, the blog will come to my mind and I will feel like I need to do something for the blog and get motivated again. There can be sometimes which I don’t want to do anything, even for the blog but I believed that blog will make me more productive and creative.</p>\n<h3>3- Portfolio! Showing all my works on my personal website.</h3>\n<hr>\n<p>This is also a serious reason to start a blog. If I was a recruiter for a software company when a CV comes to my hand I don’t want to read which language programming languages do you know, I want to know what kind of projects did you do with using those languages and how you did them. In a one paper document, it is hard to fit all the project details and people will continue to just write their programming language capabilities but in some applications, I did recently, companies want more than just a CV. In their application form, they may want your GitHub page or your personal webpage or your portfolio. Actually, my GitHub page is not impressive much these days but with starting this blog, I will also organize my GitHub page. So with that blog, I will also be creating a portfolio which shows my collection of works. Looks like I am advertising myself with the blog.</p>\n<p>These are the main reasons for starting this blog. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why I Am Starting A Blog?","date":"April 19, 2019","description":"Hi Everyone, In this post I will mention about why I am starting a blog.
