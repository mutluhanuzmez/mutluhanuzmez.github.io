&lt;p&gt;Ref: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279302/&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279302/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain works like a computer. It takes sensor values from the all body parts and process and evaluates these values and return a response to the related part.  But the processes on the brain is located in different areas in itself according to the kind of process. At the below there are sections of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279302/bin/74df19bc04f4094dc02ecea6f2d230cev1_abs_550x314_b3535db83dc50e27c1bb1392364c95a2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration: The brain&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cerebrum (upper brain)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is consisted from left hemipshere and right hemisphere.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279302/bin/c845edebfd94e1c6eb6e6a6141f7e1a6v1_abs_550x433_b3535db83dc50e27c1bb1392364c95a2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration: Right and left hemisphere&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each hemisphere is made up of &lt;em&gt;six areas (lobes)&lt;/em&gt; that have different functions. The cerebrum controls &lt;em&gt;movement&lt;/em&gt; and processes sensory information. Conscious and unconscious actions and feelings are produced here. It is also responsible for speech, hearing, intelligence and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Left hemisphere is responsible for speech and and abstract thinking but right hemisphere is responsible for spatial thinking and imagery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Left hemisphere is responsible for movement of right side of body and right hemisphere is responsible for movement of left side of body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The left cerebral cortex is responsible for speech and language. The right cerebral cortex supplies spatial information, such as where your foot is at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How signal generated on brain?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ref: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZG8M_ldA1M&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZG8M_ldA1M&lt;/a&gt;
Human body is neutral but the neurons on the brain are loaded by negative in resting state. The potential of an resting neuron is loaded to the -70mV(~). When this neuron is stimulated with biolagical events, this cell takes into itself positive loads from outer area. If the potential gets more than -55mV(~), cell gates are completely opened and it is potential gets to 40mV. After cell positive loaded, it repolarize itself to -80mV. After then, hyperpolarization starts and cell returns to the resting state(-70mV). All these, depolarization, repolarization and hyperpolarization take 2-3ms.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/b6d1e5f9615f0038a7d2e49a73fd9583e0d1b260.png&quot; alt=&quot;neuron signal ile ilgili gÃ¶rsel sonucu&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resting State 				(~-70mV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold State			(~-55mV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depolarized State 		(~ 40mV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hyperpolarized State (~-80mV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these steps, one impulse is generated on the brain. These impulse generation are same for all neurons. What makes the difference is frequency of that signals. According to it’s frequency different signals generated on the brain and these signals control the body activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is EEG?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ref:&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/vlab/biomed_signals/eeg_n.htm&quot;&gt;https://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/vlab/biomed&lt;em&gt;signals/eeg&lt;/em&gt;n.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EEG is recording of brain signals from scalp with electrodes. Different electrodes are positioned on the different locations of scalp and activities in all areas(6 area) in both hemispheres of cerebrum  are recorded. As it said before, different areas of the brain responsible for different things and the signals in different frequency in the same area also related with different things on human. These signals give some clues about the brain activity and how is related with human.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, recording EEG is similar to the mind reading. But recording the signal from the scalp makes harder to guess the activites because the signal is weak and too noisy. Obtained signal is not completely same with the signal inside brain. Using machine learning some activities can be predicted from the EEG signal and with the improven technologies these prediction areas are increasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main frequencies of EEG:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delta ( &amp;#x3C; 3Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theta (3.5Hz - 7.5Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alpha (7.5Hz - 13Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beta ( &gt; 13Hz)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting to my first blog post, I want to start with who I am and I will continue with why I am
starting a new blog and what will I share in this blog. Let’s start with who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who I Am?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Mutluhan ÜZMEZ and I am studying computer engineering in ITU. It’s my last year at university. I was born in Eskişehir, moved around in Turkey because of my parents’ work and after I got into university, I started to live in Istanbul. After starting to my university, I always tried to improve myself in the software field. I joined the ITUNOM team in my first year of university. As a team, we participated in the AUVSI SUAS competition, which is the best-known competition for students in the field of unmanned aerial systems in Maryland, USA. After 2 years of work in ITUNOM team, I started to work in a
startup which develops IOT systems for agriculture. I worked here part-time as a mobile application developer for approximately 1 year and I resigned after a year in order to focus more on the school. After a couple of months without responsibilities except school, I decided to start a blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

        alt=&quot;Starting a Blog&quot;
        title=&quot;&quot;
        src=&quot;/static/4b48a121cee129ea878b1e021a0d251a/40fad/postcover.png&quot;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why I am starting a blog?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 main reasons to start this blog for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1- Reminders! I don’t want to forget any work I do, even small things.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important reason for starting a blog is this in my perspective because when I try to do
a work which is similar or same work which is I have done before, sometimes I can not remember and
start from nothing again and again. While I am updating my CV, in the skills section I am hesitating for writing some skills which I earned before because the passing time makes you forget them and these kinds of old skills can cause problems in interviews. So in order to don’t forget any skill or even I forget, try to remember them easily, I want to collect my all work in well-documented reports and do this in blog post format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2- Motivation! I believe that this blog will make me motivate for being more productive.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most other important reason is that being more productive. After starting this blog, I need to create content for the blog, this means that I need to work more to write new posts. I need to think more about what should I do for the blog and how should I do. I am thinking like that people will be accessible to my writings, everybody can read, my writings must be completely correct. Basically, I will push myself harder to create more helpful and educative contents. Sometimes when I get lazy, the blog will come to my mind and I will feel like I need to do something for the blog and get motivated again. There can be sometimes which I don’t want to do anything, even for the blog but I believed that blog will make me more productive and creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3- Portfolio! Showing all my works on my personal website.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a serious reason to start a blog. If I was a recruiter for a software company when a CV comes to my hand I don’t want to read which language programming languages do you know, I want to know what kind of projects did you do with using those languages and how you did them. In a one paper document, it is hard to fit all the project details and people will continue to just write their programming language capabilities but in some applications, I did recently, companies want more than just a CV. In their application form, they may want your GitHub page or your personal webpage or your portfolio. Actually, my GitHub page is not impressive much these days but with starting this blog, I will also organize my GitHub page. So with that blog, I will also be creating a portfolio which shows my collection of works. Looks like I am advertising myself with the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the main reasons for starting this blog. But there are some other small reasons for me like improving my writing skills, improving my English because I am planning to write all my posts in English, improving my coding skills and improving my social skills. I hope that this writing will be helpful for you and I hope you will start your blog in a short time. After I get more experienced about developing a blog I will be posted on how I build this website and you can build your own. If there are motivated people for starting a blog, I am developing this website using Gatsby. You can google it and you can read it’s documents and start your own blog. 💪&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paper Summaries for Graduation(EEG)]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this post, there will be explanations of keywords about the subject which is EEG(electroencephalogram) and BCI(brain-computer interface…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com//paper-summaries-eeg/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com//paper-summaries-eeg/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 17:50:05 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this post, there will be explanations of keywords about the subject which is EEG(electroencephalogram) and BCI(brain-computer interface).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;unknown terms&lt;/code&gt; will be listed as randomly because I will write the explanations of term one by one when I saw one in an article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unknown Terms in the Paper for me&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor(SMR)
The &lt;strong&gt;sensorimotor rhythm&lt;/strong&gt; (SMR) is a brain wave. It is an oscillatory idle &lt;strong&gt;rhythm&lt;/strong&gt; of synchronized electric brain activity. It appears in spindles in recordings of EEG, MEG, and ECoG over the &lt;strong&gt;sensorimotor&lt;/strong&gt;cortex. For most individuals, the frequency of the SMR is in the range of 13 to 15 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motor-Imagery(MI) ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme Learning Machine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event-related Desynchronization(ERD)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Paper Examinations and Summaries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1- Multi-kernel extreme learning machine for EEG classification in brain-computer interfaces - 2017&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Authors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Yu Zhang, Yu Wang, Guoxu Zhou, Jing Jin, Bei Wang, Xingyu Wang, Andrzej Cichocki&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Motivation and brief overview (from Abstract)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goal: Designing a powerful EEG data classifier with strong  generalization capability for the development of a motor-imagery based brain-computer interface(BCI) using extreme learning machine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proposed Solution: A multi kernel extreme learning machine (ELM)(MKELM) based for motor-imagery electroencephalogram(EEG) classification. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Previous methods (Intro) &amp;#x26; their limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) works for pattern classification if the sample covariance matrices are similar among different classes. But ERD classification with LDA can cause overfitting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common spatial pattern(CSP) and SVM when they are used together, it becomes one of the most popular classifier for EEG data. Common spatial pattern is effective method for feature extraction in classifying two classes of motor imagery EEG data and SVM has good generalization capability with adopted soft margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectiveness of Bayesian ELM is validated for EEG classification. However, the randomly assigned node parameters generally result in a large variation in classification accuracy for different runnings with the same number of hiddden nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Proposed Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ELM has recently proven to be comparable or better than support vector machine(SVM) for  pattern matching. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of using a single kernel, ELM with multi kernel has recently arisen. SVM classification preceeded by CSP feature extraction is applied again and ELM also added as an extension layer to optimize the success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaussian kernel and polynomial kernel are exploited to map the original CSP features to different nonlinear feature spaces.Accordingly, by integrating both kernels, using a multi-kernel learning strategy to achieve more robust classification of EEG in MI tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discoveries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the multi-kernel extreme learning machine with both integrating gaussian kernel and polynomial kernel to take better results. The two nonlinear feature provide richer discriminant information that may be supplementary to each other. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discussion/Conclusion (their own limitations &amp;#x26; future work)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To take better results from MKEML, between two kernels there must be good balance. (Polynomial kernel and Gaussian kernel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determining the number of hidden nodes for a specific application. (Time consuming)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future work: Investigating the finding a better kernel balance parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reflection on how to adress the limitations of the paper (my ideas )&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could not see any limitations in the paper with my current knowlodge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Datasets (Result)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/&quot;&gt;http://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comparison/benchmark methods (Results section)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EEG data of each trial were band-pass filtered between 4–40 Hz that covered most ERD features re-lated to MI. Features were then extracted by CSP with parameter M =1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with this algorithms MLP, SVM, GKSVM, PKSVM, ELM, GKELM, PKELM and accuracy of algorithms showwd in table. &lt;strong&gt;MKELM has the best accuracy among each subject.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code implementation could not be found though algorithm explained in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2- Deep Learning Human Mind for Automated Visual Classification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Authors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. Spampinato, S. Palazzo, I. Kavasidis, D. Giordano&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Motivation and brief overview (from Abstract)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First EEG data combined with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to learn an discriminative brain activity manifold of visual categories in a reading the mind effort. After that, learned capabilities are transferred to machines by training a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) based regressor to project images onto the learned manifold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Previous methods (Intro) &amp;#x26; their limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous works are not satisfying for which parts of visual cortex and brain are responsible for such cognitive processes because of the difficulties of cognition-based methods to perform visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Proposed Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deep learning approach to classify EEG data evoked by visual object stimuli outperforming state-of-the-art methods both in the number of tackled object classes and in classification accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Discussion/Conclusion (their own limitations &amp;#x26; future work)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their own limitations are not mentioned clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future work is developing more complex deep learning approaches and interpretong the EEG-learned features in order to identify brain activation areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reflection on how to adress the limitations of the paper (my ideas )&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not see any limitations in the paper with my current knowlodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Datasets (Result)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dataset was created by themselves and publicly released but I could find it yet. 40 image classes taken by ImageNet and used for stimulating the brain. EEG signals are recorded by device with 128 channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comparison/benchmark methods (Results section)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance analysis divided in  three steps and they are at the below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning visual stimuli–evoked EEG data using RNN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNN-based regression to map images to RNN-learned EEG-based features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the combination of the above two steps to implement automated visual classifiers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their approach is compared with GoogleNet and VGG and it results better than VGG and almost same with the GoogleNet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Motivation and brief overview (from Abstract)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing a Deep Learning approach for EEG based MI-BCI system could potentially be used the improve current stroke rehabilitation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Previous methods (Intro) &amp;#x26; their limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper it is also mentioned that CSP and SVM most used algorithms for EEG classification but there writes also there is a previous work which MLP(multi-layer-perceptron) can be used with CSP instead of SVM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Proposed Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNN layers is used for learning generalization featuers and dimension reduction while a conventional Fully Connected(FC) layer is used for classification. Both togeher can be applied to the raw eeg signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discoveries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study has also shown that the predictor draws most relevant information from the beginning and the end of the imagined movement rather than the period in between. (quotation from the paper)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discussion/Conclusion (their own limitations &amp;#x26; future work)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This algorithm gives the best accuracy among all of them but competitors algorithm does not represent the current state of research in this area but accuracy is close to the %80 and coud be count as a success. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep learning need more data samples than other machine learning algorithms like SVM. It is one of the limitation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Work&lt;/strong&gt; A recurrent or other further developed models may be constructed in a way so it can use the presence of a probable movement onset to increase its prediction certainty for the following part of the recording as the movement type never changes abruptly in the given experimental paradigm.(quotation from the paper)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reflection on how to adress the limitations of the paper (my ideas )&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not see any limitations in the paper with my current knowlodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Datasets (Result)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selected global classifier reached 80.38%, 69.82%, and 58.58% mean accuracies for datasets with two, three, and four classes, respectively, validated using 5-fold crossvalidation. As a novel approach in this context, transfer learning was used to adapt the global classifier to single individuals improving the overall mean accuracy to 86.49%, 79.25%, and 68.51%, respectively. The global models were trained on 3s segments of EEG data from different subjects than they were tested on, which proved the generalization performance of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comparison/benchmark methods (Results section)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This algorithm compared with other 5 algorithms which do not represent the state-of-art. Proposed algorithm outcomes all of them and gives the best accuracy among them.
